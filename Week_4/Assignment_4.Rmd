### Introduction to Tidy Data
Tidying the data means giving it a consistent structure. Tidy data is easier to manipulate, analyze, and visualize. A dataset is considered tidy if it follows 
these three rules:

```{=html}
<style>
.blue-text { color: #0077B6; }
</style>
```
1.  [Each variable forms a column.]{.blue-text}\
2.  [Each observation forms a row.]{.blue-text}\
3.  [Each value has its own cell]{.blue-text}

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RSocrata)
library(janitor)
library(gsheet)
library(png)
library(grid)
library(cowplot)
```

```{r load-data, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
url <- 'docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1voYjtCYl1bHFKC-LfLyrWmkP5jeSVXTLK4Z2W12wth8'
data <- gsheet2text(url, format='csv')
airline_data <- read_csv(data)
```

<br>

To demonstrate tidying data, we can work with an example dataset showing airline arrival delays for America West Airlines and Alaska Airlines: ![Airline Data](/cloud/project/Week_4/airline_data.png)

<br>

When the data is loaded into R however, it looks different from how it does 
above:

```{r ex-messy-data, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(airline_data, format ="markdown")
```

This is because R does not know how to interpret empty headers and missing data, 
so it creates the column titles '...1' and '...2' and assigns the missing values 
as NA.

<br> 

To tidy the data, we can remove the empty row, rename the columns that are titled incorrectly, and replace the incorrect "NA" values with the associated airlines.

```{r tidying-data, include=TRUE}
airline_data_cleaned <- airline_data |>
                            remove_empty("rows") |>
                            rename("Airline" = "...1",
                                   "Type" = "...2") |> 
  fill(`Airline`)
```

### Tidy Data by Pivoting Longer 
Then, to make sure that the data can be analyzed, the data should be pivoted longer, so that each row is an observation, depicting flight arrivals and delay
by count:

```{r transforming-data, include=TRUE}
airline_data_cleaned <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
                            pivot_longer( cols = c("Los Angeles",
                                                   "Phoenix", 
                                                   "San Diego",
                                                   "San Francisco",
                                                   "Seattle"),
                                                   names_to= "Cities", 
                                                   values_to="Count") 
```


### Pivot Wider and Calculate Totals
To visualize and analyze the data, it may be helpful to have a column that includes the total number of flights, and pivot the data wider:
```{r add-type-cols, include=TRUE, message=FALSE,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
airline_data_cleaned <- airline_data_cleaned |>  
pivot_wider(names_from = Type, 
            values_from = `Count`) |> 
  mutate(Total = `on time` + `delayed`) |> 
  rename("On Time" = "on time",
         "Delayed" = "delayed") |> 
  mutate(Airline = case_when(Airline == "AM WEST"~"America West",
                             Airline == "ALASKA"~"Alaska"))
```


### Summaries of Airline Performance
```{r summary-table, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
summary <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
  group_by(Airline) |> 
  summarise(`On Time` = sum(`On Time`), `Delayed` =sum(`Delayed`), `Total`=sum(`Total`))

knitr::kable(summary, format ="markdown")

summary_plot <- summary |> pivot_longer(
  cols = c("Delayed","On Time"),
  names_to= "Status", 
  values_to="Count"
)
```

The table above shows the total numbers of flights, delayed flights, and on-time
flights by airline. From this table, it is apparent that America West had more 
total flights.

<br>

```{r summary-plot, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(summary_plot, aes(fill=Status, y=Count, x=Airline)) + 
    geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity",width = 0.5)+
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("Delayed"="#EF5A6F","On Time"="#536493"))+
    labs(
    title = "Flight Statuses by Airline",
    x = "Airline",
    y = "Count"
  )+
    theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
<br>

This plot shows the flight statuses by airline. From this plot, it seems that America West has a slightly higher rate of delayed flights than Alaska Airlines.

<br>

#### Summary Table of Delayed Flights
```{r summary-delay-table, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
summary_delays <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
  group_by(Airline) |> 
  summarise(`Median Number of Delayed Flights` = median(Delayed), `Mean Number of Delayed Flights`=mean(Delayed),`IQR of Delayed Flights` = IQR(Delayed), `Total Delayed Flights` = sum(`Delayed`),`Total Number of Flights`=sum(`Total`))

knitr::kable(summary_delays, format ="markdown")
```

The table above shows the median, mean, and interquartile range for delayed flights by airline. It also provides the total number of delayed flights, and total flights by airline. America West has higher median and mean values for delayed flights. The interquartile range (IQR) describes the spread of the data, and a high IQR can indicate that the data is more spread out, than a smaller IQR.

<br>

#### Summary Table of On-Time Flights
``` {r summary-ontime-table, include=TRUE}
summary_ontime <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
  group_by(Airline) |> 
  summarise(`Median Number of On-Time Flights` = median(`On Time`), `Mean Number of On-Time Flights`=mean(`On Time`),`IQR of On-Time Flights` = IQR(`On Time`), `Total On-Time Flights Flights` = sum(`On Time`),`Total Number of Flights`=sum(`Total`))

knitr::kable(summary_ontime, format ="markdown")
```

The table above shows the median, mean, and interquartile range for on-time flights by airline. It also provides the total number of delayed flights, and 
total flights by airline. Since America West's median value for on-time flights 
is lower than the mean, this indicates the distribution is right-skewed for on-time flights.

<br>

### Delayed Flights by City (Total)
```{r summary-delayed-flights-by-city-total, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
airline_data_cleaned |> 
  group_by(Cities) |>
  summarise(Delayed=sum(Delayed)) |> 
  arrange(Delayed) |> 
ggplot(aes
       (x = Delayed,
        y = fct_reorder(Cities, Delayed, .desc = TRUE),
          fill = Delayed)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="#F6BDC0",high="#DC1C13") +
  labs(
    title = "Delayed Flights by City",
    x = "Count of Delayed Flights",
    y = "",
    fill = "Delayed"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    legend.position="none",
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = "dotdash")
  )
  
```

### Delayed Flights by City and Airline
```{r summary-delayed-flights-by-city-airline, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

# Load images correctly
amwest_logo <- rasterGrob(readPNG("amwest.png"), interpolate = TRUE)
alaska_logo <- rasterGrob(readPNG("alaska.png"), interpolate = TRUE)

# Main Delay Plot
plot_d_c_a <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Delayed,
    y = fct_reorder(Cities, Delayed, .desc = TRUE),
    fill = Airline
  )) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Delayed Flights by City and Airline",
    x = "Count of Delayed Flights",
    y = "",
    fill = "Airline"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("America West"="#A52A2A","Alaska"="#007cba"))+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = "dotdash"),
    legend.position = "none"
  )

# Custom Legend (Logos)
legend_plot <- ggplot() +
  xlim(0, 3) + ylim(0, 3) +  # Ensure space for annotations
  theme_void() +
  annotation_custom(amwest_logo, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 1.55, ymax = 1.85) +
  annotation_custom(alaska_logo, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 1, ymax = 1.3) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.65, y = 1.70, label = "American\nWest", size = 3, hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.65, y = 1.15, label = "Alaska", size = 3, hjust = 0)

# Combine Main Plot and Legend
final_d_c_aplot <- plot_grid(plot_d_c_a, legend_plot, ncol = 2, rel_widths = c(3, 1))

print(final_d_c_aplot)
```

The plot above is similar to the Delayed Flights by City Plot, but adds more information through the stacked-bar chart, now incorporating information on airlines. In graph, it shows that most of American West's delayed flights are in Phoenix, and most of Alaska's delayed flights are in Seattle. 


### On-Time Flights by City and Airline
```{r summary-delayed-flights-by-city, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

# Main Arrival Plot
plot_o_c_a <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = `On Time`,
    y = fct_reorder(Cities, `On Time`, .desc = TRUE),
    fill = Airline
  )) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "On-Time Flights by City and Airline",
    x = "Count of On-Time Flights",
    y = "",
    fill = "Airline"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("America West"="#A52A2A","Alaska"="#007cba"))+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = "dotdash"),
    legend.position = "none"
  )

# Custom Legend (Logos)
legend_plot <- ggplot() +
  xlim(0, 3) + ylim(0, 3) +  # Ensure space for annotations
  theme_void() +
  annotation_custom(amwest_logo, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 1.55, ymax = 1.85) +
  annotation_custom(alaska_logo, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 1, ymax = 1.3) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.65, y = 1.70, label = "American\nWest", size = 3, hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.65, y = 1.15, label = "Alaska", size = 3, hjust = 0)

# Combine Main Plot and Legend
final_o_c_a_plot <- plot_grid(plot_o_c_a, legend_plot, ncol = 2, rel_widths = c(3, 1))

print(final_o_c_a_plot)

```

This plot shows the on-time flights by city and airline. Similar to the plot above, American West has the most on-time flights in Phoenix, and Alaska has the most on-time flights in Seattle.

### Flight Delay Rate by City and Airline
```{r flight-delay-rate-plot, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

plot_delay_rate <- airline_data_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    delay_rate = Delayed / Total,
    delay_label = paste0(round(100 * (Delayed / Total)), "%"),
    ) |> 
  mutate(
    city_total = sum(Total),
    city_total_label = ifelse(Airline == "Alaska", NA, paste0("(",format(sum(Total), big.mark = ","), ")")),
    .by = Cities
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(Cities, city_total))) +
  geom_bar(
    aes(
      x = delay_rate,
      fill = Airline,
    ),
    stat = "identity",
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(
      x = delay_rate + 0.03,
      group = Airline,
      label = delay_label
    ),
      position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(
      x = .42,
      y = Cities,
      label = city_total_label
    )
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  xlim(c(0, 0.45)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("Alaska" = "#124168", "America West" = "#89211a")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Delay Rate by Airline in West Coast Hub Airports",
    x = "Rate of Delay",
    y = "",
    caption = "(Total flights)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = "dotdash"),
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.caption = element_text(
      hjust = -0.3,        # Aligns caption to the left
      vjust = -1.5,       # Moves caption lower
      size = 10,
      face = "italic",
      margin = margin(t = 10)  # Adds space above the caption
    )
  )


# Custom Legend (Logos)
legend_plot <- ggplot() +
  xlim(0, 3) + ylim(0, 3) +  # Ensure space for annotations
  theme_void() +
  annotation_custom(amwest_logo, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 2, ymax = 2.3) +
  annotation_custom(alaska_logo, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = 1.5, ymax = 1.8) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.65, y = 2.15, label = "American\nWest", size = 3, hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.65, y = 1.65, label = "Alaska", size = 3, hjust = 0)

# Combine Main Plot and Legend
final_plot_delay_rate <- plot_grid(plot_delay_rate, legend_plot, ncol = 2, rel_widths = c(3, 1))

print(final_plot_delay_rate)

```

<br>

In the plots above, it was not immediately clear which city has the highest rate of delayed flights by airline. For American West, the city with the highest rate of delayed flights is San Francisco, and for Alaska, the highest rate of delayed flights is San Francisco.
