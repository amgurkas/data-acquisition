Tidying the data means giving it a consistent structure. Tidy data is easier to manipulate, analyze, and visualize. A dataset is considered tidy if it follows 
these three rules:

```{=html}
<style>
.blue-text { color: #0077B6; }
</style>
```
1.  [Each variable forms a column.]{.blue-text}\
2.  [Each observation forms a row.]{.blue-text}\
3.  [Each value has its own cell]{.blue-text}

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RSocrata)
library(janitor)
library(gsheet)
```

```{r load-data, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
url <- 'docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1voYjtCYl1bHFKC-LfLyrWmkP5jeSVXTLK4Z2W12wth8'
data <- gsheet2text(url, format='csv')
airline_data <- read_csv(data)
```

<br>

To demonstrate tidying data, we can work with an example dataset showing airline arrival delays for America West Airlines and Alaska Airlines: ![Airline Data](/cloud/project/Week_4/airline_data.png)

<br>

When the data is loaded into R however, it looks different from how it does 
above:

```{r ex-messy-data, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(airline_data, format ="markdown")
```

This is because R does not know how to interpret empty headers and missing data, 
so it creates the column titles '...1' and '...2' and assigns the missing values 
as NA.

<br> 

To tidy the data, we can remove the empty row, rename the columns that are titled incorrectly, and replace the incorrect "NA" values with the associated airlines.

```{r tidying-data, include=TRUE}
airline_data_cleaned <- airline_data |>
                            remove_empty("rows") |>
                            rename("Airline" = "...1",
                                   "Type" = "...2")


airline_data_cleaned[2,1] <- "ALASKA"
airline_data_cleaned[4,1] <- "AM WEST"
```

Then, to make sure that the data can be analyzed,the data should be pivoted longer, so that each row is an observation, depicting flight arrivals and delay times by minutes:

```{r transforming-data, include=TRUE}
airline_data_cleaned <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
                            pivot_longer( cols = c("Los Angeles",
                                                   "Phoenix", 
                                                   "San Diego",
                                                   "San Francisco",
                                                   "Seattle"),
                                                   names_to= "Cities", 
                                                   values_to="Minutes")
```

<br>


To visualize the delays, a new dataframe called 'delays' is created by 
filtering the `Type` column:
```{r delays-df, include=TRUE}
delays <- airline_data_cleaned |> 
  filter(Type =="delayed")
```

<br>

Then, by plotting the data, it can become apparent if there are any outliers:
```{r plot-delays, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = delays, aes(x=Minutes, fill="pastel")) +
geom_histogram(bins=30) +
facet_grid(rows=vars(`Airline`))+
theme(legend.position="none")
```

<br>

To see summary statistics to confirm which airline has longer delays, 
the data is grouped by airline, and the median, mean, and interquartile range
is calculated.

```{r summary-stats, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,include=TRUE}
delays |> 
group_by(Airline) |> 
summarise(median_ad = median(Minutes), mean_ad=mean(Minutes),iqr_ad = IQR(Minutes))
```

<br>
In this dataset, American West Airlines has more severe delays than Alaska 
Airlines. Both datasets have one outlier each - with American West Airline's
longest delay of 415 minutes for its flight to Phoenix. Alaska airlines median 
delay is 62 minutes, whereas American West Airlines median delay is 117 minutes.
