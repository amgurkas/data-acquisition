library(gifski) # save gif file

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Loading the NBA Data, originally taken from the [NBA Advanced Stats Site](https://www.nba.com/stats/alltime-leaders).
```{r load-data, include=FALSE}
nba_df <- read_csv("nba-top-10-career-scoring-leaders-yearly.csv")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Selecting from a range can be done either by filtering and using the ">" and "=" 
operator, or by nesting the filter and between functions:
```{r eda-range}
# filtering by range range between 1960 and 1969
nba_df_1960s_random_10 <- nba_df %>% 
  filter(YearEnd >= 1960 & YearEnd <= 1969) %>% 
  sample_n(10)
nba_df_1960s_random_10

# or: same as above but with between() method
nba_df_1960s_random_10 <- nba_df %>% 
  filter(between(YearEnd,1960,1969)) %>% 
  sample_n(10)
nba_df_1960s_random_10
```

The filter function can also be used on strings, for example, the code below
filters for Lebron James' stats:
```{r eda-filtering} 
# filter() for just LeBron
lebron <- nba_df %>% 
  filter(Player=="LeBron James")
lebron
```

```{r eda-summarise}
nba_grouped <- nba_df %>% 
  # group by player
  group_by(Player) %>% 
  # calc # of years top player & create col name Top_10_Yrs
  summarize(Top_10_Yrs=n()) %>% 
  # arrange by # of years
  arrange(desc(Top_10_Yrs)) 

# get sum total of Top 10 points by year
nba_df_sum <- nba_df %>% 
  group_by(YearEnd) %>% 
  summarize(TotPts = sum(CareerPts)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotPts)) 
```
